# Registration Form

This Registration Form was created as a practice project on FreeCodeCamp. It includes fields for first name, last name, email, and password, with built-in validation to ensure proper input. Users can select an account type (personal or business), upload a profile picture, enter their age, and specify how they found the platform. Additionally, there is an optional bio section and a required checkbox for accepting the terms and conditions. The form is structured with semantic HTML elements to enhance accessibility and usability.
